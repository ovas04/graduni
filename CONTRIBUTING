2. Describe the proposed improvement and the motivation behind it.
3. Explain how it benefits UNI students.
4. Attach mockups, diagrams, or references if available.

## Development Flow (Trunk-Based Development)

We follow Trunk-Based Development to keep integration fast and predictable.

### Initial setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/graduni.git
cd graduni

# 3. Add the upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ovas04/graduni.git

# 4. Install dependencies
npm install

# 5. Start the dev server
npm start
```

### Contribution workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Sync main from upstream] --> B[Create short-lived branch]
  B --> C[Implement scoped changes]
  C --> D[Run npm run build]
  D --> E[Push branch to origin]
  E --> F[Open draft pull request]
  F --> G[Request maintainer review]
  G --> H[Address feedback]
  H --> I[Squash and merge via maintainer]
```

1. Keep your main branch up to date:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Create a short-lived feature branch (target two to three days maximum):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/brief-description
   ```
3. Commit in small, focused increments:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add concise summary"
   ```
4. Push early and often:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/brief-description
   ```
5. Open a pull request as soon as the direction is clear. Use a descriptive title, explain the change, add screenshots for UI updates, and reference related issues.

### Review and merge

- Each pull request requires approval from at least one code owner.
- Current code owners are @ovas04, @drew2hip544, and @NaoDekoNeko.
- Reviews focus on accuracy, coherence with existing docs, responsiveness, accessibility, and convention compliance.
- Use squash-and-merge only; delete feature branches after merge and resync main frequently.

## Conventions

### Commit messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add FIGMM graduation requirements
fix: correct FIIS thesis submission deadline
docs: update contribution guidelines
style: improve mobile responsiveness for cards
```

### Branch naming

- feature/short-description
- fix/bug-identifier
- docs/topic-name
- hotfix/urgent-action

### Code standards

- Use English for code, comments, variables, and filenames.
- Keep user-facing content in Spanish.
- Avoid emojis in code; prefer inline SVG icons.
- Support dark mode for UI changes.
- Prefer CSS Modules for component-level styles.

## Testing

```bash
# Verify the build
npm run build

# Serve the production build locally
npm run serve

# Clear caches if something looks off
npm run clear
```

## Accessibility checklist

- Use semantic HTML elements.
- Provide descriptive aria-label attributes for interactive icons.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast in both themes.
- Ensure keyboard navigation works end to end.
- Smoke-test with a screen reader when possible.

## Style guide

### Color palette

- Burgundy: `#7c2d36`
- Dark Burgundy: `#5c1f28`
- Cream: `#f5f0e6`

- Avoid emojis in user-facing prose.
- Provide aria-label attributes for links and buttons that rely on icons.

## Community expectations
