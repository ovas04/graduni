# GradUNI Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to foster an open and welcoming environment. We are committed to making participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members
- Sharing academic process knowledge generously
- Helping students who are navigating complex procedures

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Deliberately spreading misinformation about academic procedures
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at:

- **GitHub**: Open a private issue or contact @ovas04
- **Email**: Add an official contact address when available

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Academic Information Expectations

Because GradUNI serves as an academic guide, we expect contributors to:

- Provide information that is accurate and verifiable
- Reference official sources whenever possible
- Clearly label personal experiences as such
- Avoid advice that conflicts with official regulations
- Respect that processes can vary between faculties
- Keep information current as procedures evolve
